                            <p>Cyber Crime or a computer-oriented crime is a crime that includes a computer and a
                                network. The computer may have been used in the execution of a crime or it may be the
                                target. Cybercrime is the use of a computer as a weapon for committing crimes such as
                                committing fraud, identity theft, or breaching privacy. Cybercrime, especially through
                                the Internet, has grown in importance as the computer has become central to every field
                                like commerce, entertainment, and government. Cybercrime may endanger a person or a
                                nation’s security and financial health.

                            <p>Cybercrime encloses a wide range of activities, but these can generally be divided into
                                two categories:</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>Crimes that aim at computer networks or devices. These types of crimes involve
                                    different threats (like virus, bugs etc.) and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.</li>
                                <li>Crimes that use computer networks to commit other criminal activities. These types
                                    of crimes include cyber stalking, financial fraud or identity theft.</li>

                      <article>
                        <h4><strong>Malware attack</strong></h4>
                          <p>
                            A malware attack is where a computer system or network is infected with a computer virus or other type of malware. A computer compromised by malware could be used by cybercriminals for several purposes. These include stealing confidential data, using the computer to carry out other criminal acts, or causing damage to data.A famous example of a malware attack was the WannaCry ransomware attack, a global cybercrime committed in May 2017. WannaCry is a type of ransomware, malware used to extort money by holding the victim’s data or device to ransom. The ransomware targeted a vulnerability in computers running Microsoft Windows. When the WannaCry ransomware attack hit, 230,000 computers were affected across 150 countries. Users were locked out of their files and sent a message demanding that they pay a Bitcoin ransom to regain access. Worldwide, the WannaCry cybercrime is estimated to have caused $4 billion in financial losses. To this day, the attack stands out for its sheer size and impact.
                          </p> 
                        <h4><strong>Phishing</strong></h4>
                          <p>
                            A phishing campaign is when spam emails, or other forms of communication, are sent with the intention of tricking recipients into doing something that undermines their security. Phishing campaign messages may contain infected attachments or links to malicious sites, or they may ask the receiver to respond with confidential information.A famous example of a phishing scam took place during the World Cup in 2018. According to our report, 2018 Fraud World Cup , the World Cup phishing scam involved emails that were sent to football fans. These spam emails tried to entice fans with fake free trips to Moscow, where the World Cup was being hosted. People who opened and clicked on the links contained in these emails had their personal data stolen. Another type of phishing campaign is known as spear-phishing. These are targeted phishing campaigns which try to trick specific individuals into jeopardizing the security of the organization they work for. 
                            
                            Unlike mass phishing campaigns, which are very general in style, spear-phishing messages are typically crafted to look like messages from a trusted source. For example, they are made to look like they have come from the CEO or the IT manager. They may not contain any visual clues that they are fake.
                          </p>  
                        <h4><strong>Distributed DoS attacks</strong></h4>
                          <p>
                            Distributed DoS attacks (DDoS) are a type of cybercrime attack that cybercriminals use to bring down a system or network. Sometimes connected IoT (Internet of Things) devices are used to launch DDoS attacks.A DDoS attack overwhelms a system by using one of the standard communication protocols it uses to spam the system with connection requests. Cybercriminals who are carrying out cyberextortion may use the threat of a DDoS attack to demand money. Alternatively, a DDoS may be used as a distraction tactic while another type of cybercrime takes place. A famous example of this type of attack is the 2017 DDoS attack on the UK National Lottery website. This brought the lottery’s website and mobile app offline, preventing UK citizens from playing. The reason behind the attack remains unknown, however, it is suspected that the attack was an attempt to blackmail the National Lottery.
                          </p>
                          <h4><strong>Spoofing</strong></h4>
                          <p>
                            Spoofing occurs when a cyber criminal disguises themself as an individual, business, or entity to commit malicious acts. Cyber criminals use various methods to spoof their identity, varying from spoofed email addresses, websites, or phone numbers to more advanced strategies like fraudulent IP addresses, Domain Name Servers (DNS), or Address Resolution Protocol (ARP). Regardless of the tactics used, the goal of a spoofing scam is to steal from victims and damage their reputations. Cyber criminals leverage common social engineering maneuvers and employ fake email addresses, websites, or contact numbers to trick victims into divulging confidential information, downloading attachments, or clicking links that install malware. Scammers ease the average victim's suspicion by relying on entities most people are familiar with, such as known brands, financial institutions, government offices, and so on. As a result, their guard is let down, making it possible to take advantage of the human nature of trust.
